Python Tool to review stats for NFL Football teams to predict a winer based upon: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772662223001364

I wanted to build a prediction model to see if I could build an application that could predict the winner of football games over 50%. While searching around I found a predictive analitics model that defines some of the key stats that can be calculated to find a winner of a game. 
The football_prediction application now will need to be filled out with the past stats for teams and ran against to teams individually now.



Steps for running project: 

1. Enter main python script in the root of a folder.
2. Build two csv's in the root of the folder with the names of the teams you wish to calculate.
  a. Within the CSV fill out all of the variables for both teams.
3. Run the python script and enter the names of the home / away teams.
